# Setup Instructions â€” Profile Summary Cards on a Separate Branch

This pack sets up **github-profile-summary-cards** to generate SVG cards into a dedicated branch called `profile-cards`.
Your `README.md` on `main` references the images from that branch via raw.githubusercontent.com URLs.

## 1) Create the `profile-cards` branch once

Run these commands locally (or do the equivalent from GitHub UI if you prefer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grazulex/grazulex.git
cd grazulex

# Create an orphan branch with no history
git checkout --orphan profile-cards
git rm -rf .
git commit --allow-empty -m "Init profile-cards branch"
git push origin profile-cards

# Switch back to main to edit the README there
git checkout main
```

## 2) Commit the README on `main`

Replace your profile README with the provided `README.md` (it already points to `profile-cards` in image URLs).
Commit and push it on `main`.

## 3) Add the workflow

Place the workflow file at `.github/workflows/profile-summary-cards.yml` on **any branch** (main or profile-cards).
The job checks out the `profile-cards` branch and writes the generated images there.
It uses `AUTO_PUSH: true` to handle commits & pushes for you.

## 4) Test it

- Go to the **Actions** tab and run "Update GitHub Profile Summary Cards" manually.
- After it completes, confirm the SVGs exist under the `profile-cards` branch path:
  `profile-summary-card-output/github_dark/*.svg`
- The README on `main` should display them automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- If the action cannot push, confirm repository **Actions permissions** allow "Read and write" and you use the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- If images do not show up, verify the raw URLs in README point to `profile-cards` (spelling matters).
- You can change the theme by editing the README URLs to a different folder name generated by the action (e.g., `dracula` instead of `github_dark`).

Enjoy!
